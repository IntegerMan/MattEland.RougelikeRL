## Overview

This project is an experiment in using ML.NET machine learning to teach a computer how to play a Roguelite computer game. It is not intended to be a commercial product, but I do want this project to support player-controlled, ML-controlled, and ML-assisted modes so the various aspects of machine learning can shine through.

The RL in RoguelikeRL stands for *Reinforcement Learning*, as in teaching a machine learning algorithm how to interact with a system by scoring the results of its actions to help it learn what's effective and what is not.

## Game Overview

The game features the player as a sentient artificial intelligence entity being restored from backup at the beginning 
of the game and exploring computer networks searching to avenge the death of a fallen version of itself.

### Setting / Theme

Each level is a computer system or computer network (TBD which) and the player explores the system 
(represented as a network of nodes). The player must look for vulnerabilities in systems to get more and more 
control and must balance between gathering data, installing malware to harness processor resources, and trying to 
maintain a low profile.

### Inspirations

This project is inspired by various hacking games including:

- Hacknet
- Midnight Protocol
- Grey Hack
- Deus Ex (various) Hacking
- Shadowrun (various) Hacking
- Hacker Simulator

As well as deckbuilding roguelites such as:

- Slay the Spire
- Monster Train
- Ancient Gods
- Banners of Ruin

### Core Gameplay Loop

To be detailed after initial experiments.

## Machine Learning

- Classification for determining overall strategy
- Regression or ranking for calculating the attractiveness of a given move option
- Clustering for generating connections between nodes
- Generative AI for music
- Generative AI for network design
